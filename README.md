 ## Description 
    The purpose of this assignment was to build a command-line application that allows employee information to be gathered then generate an HTML page that displays each persons information. The command-line starts with all the manager questions then asked if they would like to add an Enginner, Intern, or if they do not wish to add anymore employees. Once the manager has completed adding their employees an HTML webpage is generated, which dispays cards with their teams for quick access to their information.
